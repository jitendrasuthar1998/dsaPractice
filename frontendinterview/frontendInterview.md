#### what will be the output of below javascript code and why? 

```javascript
for(var i =1; i<=3;i++)
{ 
	setTimeout(()=>{ console.log(i); },1000) 
}
```

The output of the provided JavaScript code will be:

```
4
4
4
```

This might seem unexpected at first, but it occurs due to how closures work in JavaScript, combined with the asynchronous behavior of `setTimeout`.

Here's the explanation:

1. The `for` loop runs three times, with `i` being incremented from 1 to 3.
2. Inside the loop, `setTimeout` is called three times. Each call schedules a callback function to be executed after 1000 milliseconds (1 second). However, the callbacks themselves are not executed immediately; they are added to the event queue and will be executed later, after the current execution context has finished.
3. By the time the first callback is executed (after 1000 milliseconds), the loop has already finished executing, and the value of `i` is 4. This is because `var` declarations are function-scoped, not block-scoped, so the variable `i` is accessible outside the loop.
4. Since the value of `i` is 4 when the callback functions are executed, all three callback functions log the value of `i`, which is 4.

To achieve the desired behavior (printing 1, 2, and 3 with a delay of 1 second between each), you can use a closure to capture the current value of `i` for each iteration:

```javascript
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    (function (index) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(index);
        }, 1000 * i);
    })(i);
}
```

In this modified version, we create a closure by immediately invoking a function expression that captures the value of `i` for each iteration of the loop. This ensures that each callback function has access to the correct value of `i` when it is executed.


what will the output of the below javascript code and why? 
for(let i =1; i<=3;i++){ setTimeout(()=>{ console.log(i); },1000) }

The output of the provided JavaScript code will be:

```
1
2
3
```

This occurs because `let` declarations are block-scoped, unlike `var` declarations which are function-scoped. When `let` is used in a loop, a new binding for the variable `i` is created for each iteration of the loop, effectively capturing the value of `i` at each iteration.

Here's a breakdown of why the output is as expected:

1. Inside the `for` loop, `let i = 1` initializes a new binding for `i` with the value `1`.
2. For each iteration of the loop, a new block scope is created due to the `let` declaration, and the value of `i` is captured within that block scope.
3. The `setTimeout` function is called three times inside the loop, scheduling three separate callback functions to be executed after 1000 milliseconds.
4. Since each callback function forms a closure over the block scope of the loop, they each have access to the specific value of `i` that was captured during their respective iterations.
5. When each callback function is executed, it prints the value of `i` that was captured during its iteration, resulting in `1`, `2`, and `3` being printed with a delay of 1000 milliseconds between each.

This behavior demonstrates the benefit of using `let` in loops, as it avoids the common issue with `var` where a single variable is shared across multiple iterations, leading to unexpected results. With `let`, each iteration gets its own separate variable binding, ensuring that each closure captures the correct value of `i`.


#### what will the output of this ocde in javascript and why?

```javascript
setTimeout(()=>{ 
    console.log("Timeout") 
    },0); 
Promise.resolve().then(()=>console.log("Promise")) console.log("End");
```

The output of the provided JavaScript code will be:

```
End
Promise
Timeout
```

Here's the explanation of why this is the output:

1. The `console.log("End")` statement is executed synchronously and prints "End" to the console.

2. `Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"))` creates a Promise that resolves immediately (asynchronous microtask) and schedules a callback function to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop. So, "Promise" is printed to the console after "End".

3. `setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0)` schedules another callback function to be executed after 0 milliseconds. However, even though the delay is 0 milliseconds, the callback is still executed as a task in the event loop, which happens after the microtask queue (where Promise callbacks reside). Therefore, "Timeout" is printed to the console after "Promise".

In summary, while both the Promise and setTimeout are asynchronous, Promise callbacks are queued in the microtask queue, while setTimeout callbacks are queued in the task queue. The microtask queue has higher priority than the task queue, so Promise callbacks are executed before setTimeout callbacks, even if they have a shorter delay.
